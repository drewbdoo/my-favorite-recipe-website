    <h1>Directions for Bangin' Brownies</h1>
    <h2>Make sure you have all the <a href="ingredients.html">ingredients</a> before beginning.</h2>
<h3>Also helpful to make sure you have all the needed tools such as a mixing bowl, baking pan, etc</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in <em>two separate bowls</em>. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>

        <li>Dry ingredients in a mixing bowl</li>
        
        <li>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
        
                
        <li>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
        
        <li>Pouring batter into a pan</li>
        
        <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
        
        <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!</li>
