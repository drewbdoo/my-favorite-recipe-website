    <h1>Bangin' Brownies How-to</h1><hr>
    <img src="brownie1.jpg" width="300"><hr>
    <p>Let's be honest. <br><br> Who on this earth doesn't love the soft pillows of absolute love that are brownie. <b>Nothing</b> compares to the feeling that comes from the smell of brownies cooking; nothing is harder than resisting the urge to dive right into them as soon as they come out of the oven. No matter who you are, there is a brownie for you. Extra dark chocolate, with or without nuts, even without chocolate! (Though, in fairness, that would be a blondie and isn't covered here)</p><br>
    <p>Load up on all the <a href="ingredients.html">gear you'll need</a> and follow these <a href="directions.html">steps</a> for a pretty rock solid basic recipie with a few caveats of my own along the way to help you make the best brownie possible</p>
